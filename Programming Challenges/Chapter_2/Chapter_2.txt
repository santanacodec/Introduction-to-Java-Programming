■■ To use constants to store permanent data (§2.7).
■■ To name classes, methods, variables, and constants by following their 
naming conventions (§2.8).

long, float, and double (§2.9.1).
■■ To read a byte, short, int, long, float, or double value from the 
keyboard (§2.9.2).
■■ To perform operations using operators +, -, *, /, and % (§2.9.3).
